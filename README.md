On the wider ranges of the internet, I am primarily known as Geolykt or just Geol. One probably knows me from me helping people (or at least trying to do so) in one or the other place. On GitHub I at times manifest myself as someone that will speak with seemingly full authority on matters where I might be a dunce.

However, when I do programm things it often tends to be related to Galimulator modding or writing random general-purpose java libraries.

I currently actively develop:
 - [The Starloader Launcher](https://github.com/stianloader/Starloader)
 - [SLAPI, a mod compatibility and abstraction layer for Galimulator](https://github.com/stianloader/Starloader-API)
 - [Micromixin, a reimplementation of Sponge's Mixin framework](https://github.com/stianloader/Micromixin)
 - [GslStarplane](https://github.com/stianloader/GslStarplane)
 - [StarCellShading, a mod for galimulator that overhauls star rendering logic](https://github.com/Geolykt/StarCellShading)
 - [Faststar, a galimulator mod focused on performance](https://github.com/Geolykt/FastStar)

I maintain, but don't actively develop:
 - [Picoresolve, a reimplementation of the Maven Artifact Resolver](https://github.com/stianloader/PicoResolve)
 - [Stianloader-concurrent, a collection (cough) of concurrent data structures written in pure java](https://github.com/stianloader/stianloader-concurrent)

Stagnant projects (these projects have been out of rotation for a long time now, but aren't actually abandonned):
 - [EnchantmentsPlus](https://github.com/Geolykt/EnchantmentsPlus)
 - [Stianloaders's deobfuscator - Sl-Deobf](https://github.com/stianloader/Sl-deobf)

I have a bunch of other projects however they tend to move in and out of rotation quite frequently so they are not
listed here. Generally for as long as a repository is not archived I will still give out support to it.

I work on all of my stuff voluntarily, please do not expect that I continue to work on these projects.
If you wish to help my projects financially, it is best to give the aid to upstream projects
that are usually neglected otherwise.

Alternatively - if you have some kind of skill that I completely lack (i.e. being good at art, music,
storytelling, etc etc.) and wish to help - then feel free to contact me via discord, email or some other
way.
