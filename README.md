I am known on the wider ranges of the internet as Geolykt or Geol. I am primarily a java developer in my spare time where I work with modding projects, where as I am quite fond of pioneering galimulator bytecode modding.

I currently actively develop:
 - [The Starloader API](https://github.com/Starloader-project/Starloader-API)
 - [Micromixin](https://github.com/Starloader-project/Micromixin)

I maintain, but don't actively develop:
 - [EnchantmentsPlus](https://github.com/Geolykt/EnchantmentsPlus)
 - [The Starloader Launcher](https://github.com/Starloader-project/Starloader)
 - [Starloader's deobfuscator - Sl-Deobf](https://github.com/Starloader-project/Sl-deobf)
 - [Starloader's Brachyura fork](https://github.com/Starloader-project/slbrachyura)

I work on all of my stuff voluntarily, please do not expect that I continue to work on these projects.
However I also do not accept anything in return (outside of contributions and kind words),
if you wish to help my projects, it is best to give the aid to upstream projects that are usually neglected otherwise
