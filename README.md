On the wider ranges of the internet, I am primarily known as Geolykt or just Geol. One probably knows me from me helping people (or at least trying to do so) in one or the other place. On GitHub I at times manifest myself as someone that will speak with seemingly full authority on matters where I might be a dunce.

However, when I do programm things it often tends to be related to Galimulator modding or writing random general-purpose java libraries.

I currently actively develop:
 - [SLAPI, a mod compatibility and abstraction layer for Galimulator](https://github.com/stianloader/Starloader-API)
 - [Micromixin, a reimplementation of Sponge's Mixin framework](https://github.com/stianloader/Micromixin)
 - [GslStarplane](https://github.com/stianloader/GslStarplane)

I maintain, but don't actively develop:
 - [The Starloader Launcher](https://github.com/stianloader/Starloader)
 - [Picoresolve, a reimplementation of the Maven Artifact Resolver](https://github.com/stianloader/PicoResolve)

Stagnant projects (these projects have been out of rotation for a long time now, but aren't actually abandonned):
 - [EnchantmentsPlus](https://github.com/Geolykt/EnchantmentsPlus)
 - [Stianloaders's deobfuscator - Sl-Deobf](https://github.com/stianloader/Sl-deobf)

I have a bunch of other projects however they tend to move in and out of rotation quite frequently so they are not
listed here. Generally for as long as a repository is not archived I will still give out support to it.

I work on all of my stuff voluntarily, please do not expect that I continue to work on these projects.
However I also do not accept anything in return (outside of contributions and kind words),
if you wish to help my projects, it is best to give the aid to upstream projects that are usually neglected otherwise
